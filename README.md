# NBA-Advanced-Stats-Calculator
#The use of advanced stats has become prevalent in sports, especially the NBA. A lot of the ways that players are signed, drafted or ranked are based on advanced stats. Advanced stats are basically the summary of raw stats, such as points, rebounds, assists, ect.,
# that tells the story of how good a player is. The two advanced stats that this program will rank are usage and effective field goal percentage.
# Usage tells how much a player is being according to the number of shots they take and the number of turnovers they have. 
# Effective field goal percentage shows how well a player is shooting while taking in the fact that 3 pointers are worth more than 2, something regular field goal percentage does not account or. 
#This project will take the raw stats of a number of players from a user, plug those raw stats into formulas that gives usage and effective field goal percentage and rank the players according to both o those statistics
